## How to Use

1. **Create Database**
   Run the `CREATE DATABASE` and `USE` statements to create and switch to the `online_store_sql` database.

2. **Create Tables**
   Execute the `CREATE TABLE` statements in order: `Customers`, `Products`, `Orders`.

3. **Insert Sample Data**
   Populate each table with the provided `INSERT INTO` statements.

4. **Query Example**
   To view all customers:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Customers;
   ```

## Notes

* All foreign keys are enforced to maintain referential integrity.
* The database schema avoids NULLs where not necessary by using `NOT NULL`.
* Product prices are stored using the `DECIMAL(10,2)` data type for accurate currency representation.
